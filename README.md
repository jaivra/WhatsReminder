# WhatsReminder
WhatsReminder reminds you to send a message on WhatsApp to a specific contact at a specific time. You can choose the contact, the hour, and if it's recurring, enter the message, and WhatsReminder will automatically open the chat with that particular contact at the specified time. It will enter the message and advise you with a custom alarm. Simply confirm your desire to send a message, and that is all that is required
